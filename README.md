`version 1.0`
`challenge status: open`

Welcome! We've been expecting you. Holmusk is a big data based high tech company with the vision to use data science to revolutionize healthcare worldwide.

If you're someone who bleeds code and aches to make a difference in the world, then you are at the right place. You will be part of a world‑class team working on the most exciting ground‑breaking technology in an inspiring and collaborative environment.


## Basics

This is the Holmusk iOS Engineer challenge. The rules of the challenge are as follows:

* Your code should be commented.
* Because we, at Holmusk, take code organization seriously, please do ensure your source files are organized when you submit.
* Please complete the challenge and email your solution in a zip file to viethai.pham@holmusk.com along with high-level descriptions of said solution.
* Please note that you will also be judged on the elegance of your code, level of abstraction and technical skills presented in the implementation. For more details, refer to the Judging Criteria section below.

## The Challenge 

Please take a look at <https://github.com/protoman92/HMRequestFramework-iOS.git> before attempting the challenge, because we will be relying heavily on it.

### What You'll need to build

- Create a simple note-taking iOS application that can create notes, save them to **CoreData** and stream created notes to a **UITableView**.
- The display **UITableView** should be editable so that users can swipe to delete notes. Rearrangement is not necessary.
- The minimum number of screens is 2: one for the main display screen with created notes, and one for the creation/deletion/editing.
- Each **Note** should have a ***title***, ***description***, ***deadline***, ***timestamp***. The data should be well-represented in each **UITableViewCell**. You can add additional functionalities as well (e.g. timer).
- The architecture for this application should be **MVVM** with **RxSwift**.
- Bonus points will be given for unit tests (in fact, a lot more points).
- You can look at the demo apps in the request framework repository for an idea of how the framework functions.

## Judging Criteria
- The deadline for this challenge is 1 week. It is fine to submit earlier, however.
- What you have produced will determine your final outcome.

** With that said we wish you good luck and look forward to receiving your submission!
